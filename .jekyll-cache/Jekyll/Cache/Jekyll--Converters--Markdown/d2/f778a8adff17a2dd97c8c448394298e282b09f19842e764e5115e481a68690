I"ü<h2 id="about-my-name">About my name</h2>

<p>My earlier full name used to be â€œPoorna Chandra Tejasvi Girish Kumar Kashiâ€. As it was inconveniently long for most purposes (evidently), I have legally shortened it to â€œTejasvi Kashiâ€. I now prefer â€œTejasviâ€ as my first name. â€œTejâ€ is fine too, if itâ€™s difficult to pronounce my full first name. Those who know me as â€œPoornaâ€ can continue addressing me so. Close friends and family anyway knew me as â€œTejasviâ€ from the beginning.</p>
