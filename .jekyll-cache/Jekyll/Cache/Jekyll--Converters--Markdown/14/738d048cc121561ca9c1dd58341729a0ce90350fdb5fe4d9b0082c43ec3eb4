<p><img class="profile-picture" src="new-photo.JPG" /></p>

<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I’m Tejasvi. (see <a href="misc">this</a> if something doesn’t add up) I am currently an MMath CS thesis student at the University of Waterloo advised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~kmsalem/">Prof. Ken Salem</a>. Before this, I was a Senior Software Engineer at AI &amp; Robotics Technology Park (<a href="https://artpark.in">ARTPARK</a>) - a joint venture by the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in">Indian Institute of Science</a> and <a href="https://www.aifoundry.ai/">Aifoundry</a>. Previously, I was a Technical Associate at the <a href="https://cps.iisc.ac.in">Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems</a>, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Currently, I work on transaction durability in databases with Prof Salem. In my earlier role, I used to work on backend systems, databases and automation.</p>

<p>Other than professional/academic interests, I really enjoy intriguing short stories and western classical music (Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Tchaikovsky and the like)</p>

<!--- My research interests are in understanding how to build large systems with ease. Currently I am working on building a large-scale privacy preserving data exchange and analytics platform with folks from UIDAI and Microsoft Research.

<!-- ## Interesting Projects

* Aarogya Setu Anonymisation9: Developed an anonymisation framework to hide personally identifiable information from the Aarogya Setu self-assessment chat dataset. This framework, while preserving privacy, retained all the characteristics needed for predictive modelling of COVID-19 hotspots.

* Indian Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)10: Was involved in the core team of developing a common data ex- change platform for smart cities in India. This project was funded by the Govt. of India. IUDX is deployed “in-production" in two Indian cities namely, Pune and Varanasi

* Vermillion: A scalable and highly-available IoT middleware for smart cities, built for speed and respon- siveness. This middleware was the final and most mature implementation among the previous iterations of IoT middlewares that we had built. This is currently deployed as a part of the IUDX stack.

* Corinthian13: Built a faster and more robust version of IDEAM using Kore, a fast and secure web platform written in C. This project also comprised of microservices deployed using Docker.

* IoT Data Exchange and Analytics Middleware (IDEAM)14: This was an initial version of the smart city data exchange platform. This platform comprised various microservices which were developed using Undertow and deployed using Docker and Ansible.

* Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for Smart-city Middlewares15: It was a security layer built for smart-city middlewares to prevent attacks by malicious users. It was capable of protecting against DoS attacks and some kinds of exploits by observing patterns from log files and using blockchain techniques
