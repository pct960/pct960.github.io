## About my name

My earlier full name used to be "Poorna Chandra Tejasvi Girish Kumar Kashi". As it was inconveniently long for most purposes (evidently), I have legally shortened it to "Tejasvi Kashi". I now prefer "Tejasvi" as my first name. "Tej" is fine too, if it's difficult to pronounce my first name. Those who know me as "Poorna" can continue addressing me so. Close friends and family anyway knew me as "Tejasvi" from the beginning.
